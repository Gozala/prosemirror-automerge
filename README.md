## prosemirror + automerge

This is a 100% experimental, not-actually-working-yet attempt to get Automerge (p2p-friendly CRDT implementation) working with ProseMirror (best-in-class rich text library).

Can be viewed by running `npm run build` & opening `demo.html` in the browser. Inserting characters works, deleting (and basically everything else) doesn't.
